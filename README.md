# Game of Life in Pygame

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using Pygame. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

## Features

- Interactive grid where you can toggle cells on and off.
- Adjustable grid size and simulation speed.
- Pause and resume the simulation.
- Generate random initial states or clear the grid.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
- Numpy

## Installation

1. Install Python 3.x from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
2. Install Pygame and Numpy using pip:
    ```
    pip install pygame numpy
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the script:
    ```
    python GameOfLife.py
    ```

## Controls

- **Spacebar**: Pause/Resume the simulation.
- **Mouse Click**: Toggle cells on and off (when paused).
